Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, meeting in Paris from 12 October to 14 November 1970, at its sixteenth session,</p><p>Recalling the importance of the provisions contained in the Declaration of the Principles of International Cultural Co-operation, adopted by the General Conference at its fourteenth session,</p><p>Considering that the interchange of cultural property among nations for scientific, cultural and educational purposes increases the knowledge of the civilization of Man, enriches the cultural life of all peoples and inspires mutual respect and appreciation among nations,</p><p>Considering that cultural property constitutes one of the basic elements of civilization and national culture, and that its true value can be appreciated only in relation to the fullest possible information regarding its origin, history and traditional setting,</p><p>Considering that it is incumbent upon every State to protect the cultural property existing within its territory against the dangers of theft, clandestine excavation, and illicit export,</p><p>Considering that, to avert these dangers, it is essential for every State to become increasingly alive to the moral obligations to respect its own cultural heritage and that of all nations,</p><p>Considering that, as cultural institutions, museums, libraries and archives should ensure that their collections are built up in accordance with universally recognized moral principles,</p><p>Considering that the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural property is an obstacle to that understanding between nations which it is part of UNESCO’s mission to promote by recommending to interested States, international conventions to this end,</p><p>Considering that the protection of cultural heritage can be effective only if organized both nationally and internationally among States working in close co-operation,</p><p>Considering that the UNESCO General Conference adopted a Recommendation to this effect in 1964,</p><p>Having before it further proposals on the means of prohibiting and preventing the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural property, a question which is on the agenda for the session as item 19,</p><p>Having decided, at its fifteenth session, that this question should be made the subject of an international convention,</p><p>Adopts this Convention on the fourteenth day of November 1970.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Article-1"><a href="#Article-1" class="headerlink" title="Article 1"></a>Article 1</h2><p>For the purposes of this Convention, the term `cultural property’ means property which, on religious or secular grounds, is specifically designated by each State as being of

anatomy, and objects of paleontological interest;</p><p>(b) property relating to history, including the history of science and technology and military and social history, to the life of national

engraved seals;</p><p>(f) objects of ethnological interest;</p><p>(g) property of artistic interest, such as:</p><blockquote><p>(i) pictures, paintings and drawings produced entirely by hand on any support and in any material (excluding industrial designs and manufactured articles decorated by hand);<br>(ii) original works of statuary art and sculpture in any material;<br>(iii) original

class="headerlink" title="Article 2"></a>Article 2</h2><p>The States Parties to this Convention recognize that the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural property is one of the main causes of the impoverishment of the cultural heritage of the countries of origin of such property and that international co-operation constitutes one of the most efficient means of protecting each country’s cultural property against all the dangers resulting there from.</p><p>To this end, the States Parties undertake to oppose such practices with the means at their disposal, and particularly by removing their causes, putting a stop to current practices, and by helping to make the necessary reparations.</p><h2 id="Article-3"><a href="#Article-3" class="headerlink" title="Article 3"></a>Article 3</h2><p>The import, export or transfer of ownership of cultural property effected contrary to the provisions adopted under this Convention by the States Parties thereto, shall be illicit.</p><h2 id="Article-4"><a href="#Article-4" class="headerlink" title="Article 4"></a>Article 4</h2><p>The States Parties to this Convention recognize that for the purpose of the

competent authorities of the country of origin of such property;</p><p>(d) cultural property which has been the subject of a freely agreed exchange;</p><p>(e) cultural property received as a gift or purchased legally with the consent of the competent authorities of the country of origin of such property.</p><h2 id="Article-5"><a href="#Article-5" class="headerlink" title="Article 5"></a>Article

to set up within their territories one or more national services, where such services do not already exist, for the protection of the cultural heritage, with a qualified staff sufficient in number for the effective carrying out of the following functions:</p><p>(a) contributing to the formation of draft laws and regulations designed to secure the protection of the cultural heritage and particularly prevention of the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of important cultural property;</p><p>(b) establishing and keeping up to date, on the basis of a national inventory of protected property, a list of important public and private cultural property whose export would constitute an appreciable impoverishment of the national cultural heritage;</p><p>(c) promoting the development or the establishment of scientific and technical institutions (museums, libraries, archives, laboratories, workshops…) required to ensure the preservation and presentation of cultural property;</p><p>(d) organizing the supervision of archaeological excavations, ensuring the preservation “in situ” of certain cultural property, and protecting certain areas reserved for future archaeological research;</p><p>(e) establishing, for the benefit of those concerned (curators, collectors, antique dealers, etc.) rules in conformity with the ethical principles set forth in this Convention; and taking steps to ensure the observance of those rules;</p><p>(f) taking educational measures to stimulate and develop respect for the cultural heritage of all States, and spreading knowledge of the

that the export of the cultural property in question is authorized. The certificate should accompany all items of cultural property exported in accordance with the regulations;</p><p>(b) to prohibit the exportation of cultural property from their territory unless accompanied by the above-mentioned export certificate;</p><p>(c) to publicize this prohibition by appropriate means, particularly among persons likely to export or import cultural property.</p><h2 id="Article-7"><a href="#Article-7" class="headerlink" title="Article 7"></a>Article 7</h2><p>The States Parties to this Convention undertake:</p><p>(a) To take the necessary measures, consistent with national legislation, to prevent museums and similar institutions within their territories from acquiring cultural property originating in another State Party which has been illegally exported after entry into force of this Convention, in the States concerned. Whenever possible, to inform a State of origin Party to this Convention of an offer of such cultural property illegally removed from that State after the entry into force of this Convention in both States;</p><p>(b)</p><blockquote><p>(i) to prohibit the import of cultural property stolen from a museum or a religious or secular public monument or similar institution in another State Party to this Convention after the entry into force of this Convention for the States concerned, provided that such property is documented as appertaining to the inventory of that institution;<br>(ii) at the request of the State Party of origin, to take appropriate steps to recover and return any such cultural property imported after the entry into force of this Convention in both States concerned, provided, however, that the requesting State shall pay just compensation to an innocent purchaser or to a person who has valid title to that property. Requests for recovery and return shall be made through diplomatic offices. The requesting Party shall furnish, at its expense, the documentation and other evidence necessary to establish its claim for recovery and return. The Parties shall impose no customs duties or other charges upon cultural property returned pursuant to this Article. All expenses incident to the return and delivery of the cultural property shall be borne by the requesting Party.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Article-8"><a href="#Article-8" class="headerlink" title="Article 8"></a>Article 8</h2><p>The States Parties to this Convention undertake to impose penalties or administrative sanctions on any person responsible for infringing the prohibitions referred to under Articles 6 (b) and 7 (b) above.</p><h2 id="Article-9"><a href="#Article-9" class="headerlink" title="Article 9"></a>Article 9</h2><p>Any State Party to this Convention whose cultural patrimony is in jeopardy from pillage of archaeological or ethnological materials may call upon other States Parties who are affected. The States Parties to this Convention undertake, in these circumstances, to participate in a concerted international effort to determine and to carry out the necessary concrete measures, including the control of exports and imports and international commerce in the specific materials concerned. Pending agreement each State concerned shall take provisional measures to the extent feasible to prevent irremediable injury to the cultural heritage of the requesting State.</p><h2 id="Article-10"><a href="#Article-10" class="headerlink" title="Article 10"></a>Article 10</h2><p>The States Parties to this Convention undertake:</p><p>(a) To restrict by education, information and vigilance, movement of cultural property illegally removed from any State Party to this Convention and, as appropriate for each country, oblige antique dealers, subject to penal or administrative sanctions, to maintain a

the export prohibition to which such property may be subject;</p><p>(b) to endeavour by educational means to create and develop in the public mind a realization of the value of cultural property and the threat to the cultural heritage created by theft, clandestine excavations and illicit exports.</p><h2 id="Article-11"><a href="#Article-11" class="headerlink" title="Article 11"></a>Article 11</h2><p>The export and transfer of ownership of cultural property under compulsion arising directly or indirectly from the occupation of a country by a foreign power shall be regarded as illicit.</p><h2 id="Article-12"><a href="#Article-12" class="headerlink" title="Article 12"></a>Article 12</h2><p>The States Parties to this Convention shall respect the cultural heritage within the territories for the international relations of which they are responsible, and shall take all appropriate measures to prohibit and prevent the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of

consistent with the laws of each State:</p><p>(a) To prevent by all appropriate means transfers of ownership of cultural property likely to promote the illicit import or export of such property;</p><p>(b) to ensure that their competent services co-operate in facilitating the earliest possible restitution of illicitly exported cultural property to its rightful owner;</p><p>(c) to admit actions for recovery of lost or stolen items of cultural property brought by or on behalf of the rightful owners ;</p><p>(d) to recognize the indefeasible right of each State Party to this Convention to classify and declare certain cultural property as inalienable which should therefore ipso facto not be exported, and to facilitate recovery of such property by the State concerned in cases where it has been exported.</p><h2 id="Article-14"><a href="#Article-14" class="headerlink" title="Article 14"></a>Article 14</h2><p>In order to prevent illicit export and to meet the obligations arising from the implementation of this Convention, each State Party to the Convention should, as far as it is able, provide the national services responsible for the protection of its

15</h2><p>Nothing in this Convention shall prevent States Parties thereto from concluding special agreements among themselves or from continuing to implement agreements already concluded regarding the
